# SD Worx Front-End Challenge

Your challenge this evening is to prepare a website that will present a datatable using the following [API](https://63998da716b0fdad77409a5e.mockapi.io/api/v1/hikers).

Refrain from using any visual frameworks, like bootstrap, Angular material, ngx-ui, or others, while building the webpage​

You can open the Figma sample to get as close a possible to the premade designs​. Links can be found in their respective sections below.

The pages must both support desktop and mobile versions​

## Judging Criteria

- Your application is running​
- Implementation of all functionalities in relation to the Figma designs​
- HTML/CSS/code organization​
- How you present your work​


# Tips 

You don't have much time, first try to provide functionality, and then if you have time refine the designs.​

Remember to push all changes to your fork on GitHub before the time expires!​

If you have any problems or questions, please do not hesitate to ask our jurors.​

Good luck, and may the best developer win!
